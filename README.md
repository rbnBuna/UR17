## Project description

* In this project the tap model from the project RobCoG has been extended by further functions to achieve an even more realistic simulation. The tap can now be switched on and off by virtual hands in VR. When switched on, water flows out of the tap, which behaves physically correct and looks realistic. The water is simulated with Nvidia's Flex particle technology.

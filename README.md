Unreal Robots (2017-18) master project repository

# Info
>>>>>>> upstream/master

* each branch belongs to a given subproject, e.g. `ur17-p1` belongs to subproject P1
* every branch has the up to date `dev-env` branch from [RobCoG](https://github.com/robcog-iai/RobCoG/tree/dev-env) as default
* every subproject will create a pull request for each milestone on its corresponding branch
* every pull request should have a `MilestoneX.md` file, in `/Documentation` for every milestone, describing the milestone, what has been done(documentation), how to test the code(working/tested tutorials).
* the pull request (if containing source code) should be contained in a plugin, e.g. `\Plugins\MyPlugin`
* the pull request (if containing new uassets, e.g. meshes, etc.) can be done on the project directly, it should however include the 3D mesh files as well in `.fbx` and `.dae` format in the folder `\Documentation\Meshes`

* In this project the tap model from the project RobCoG has been extended by further functions to achieve an even more realistic simulation. The tap can now be switched on and off by virtual hands in VR. When switched on, water flows out of the tap, which behaves physically correct and looks realistic. The water is simulated with Nvidia's Flex particle technology.

### Documentation

* Documentation of the project of when it is **finalized**, written in the `Documentation/Documentation.md` file
* This should basically be a combination of all the milestone descriptions
* The above bulletpoints should obviously removed in the pull request, and replaced with something like: The documentation of the project can be found [here](Documentation/Documentation.md).
